## Problem Statement üöß

Most of us like to plan our outings to nearby beaches but often, we miss out on checking essential details like the weather, taking the temperature and humidity into consideration, when we pack things to carry with ourselves.

## Background üìñ

Say Hi to Jack üë¶. Jack loves visiting the Long Beach but often comes home sunburnt. If you ask us why, it's because he never carries sunscreen with him. Jack's mum really hates that.

If only Jack could find a Website that would give him recommendations for things to carry according to the weather at the Long Beach... ü§î

## Solution üí°
Meet Maeve üëß! Maeve is Jack's classmate and guess what, she also loves visiting nearby beaches!

Well, Maeve heard about Jack's problem and she immediately recommended this website she always refers to before leaving for her favorite beach, [visitabeach.online](http://www.visitabeach.netlify.app)!

Through **Visit a Beach**, Maeve is able to track the weather at Long Beach and by interacting with the chatbot available, she is also notified of all the things that she should carry according to the temparature and the humidity at the beach (including a sunscreen!).

Moreover, she gets some amazing quotes and captions that she can use to flaunt her pictures taken at the beach over Social Media!
